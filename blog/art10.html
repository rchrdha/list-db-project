                Taiwanese designer Peng Tai brings the concept of elemental harmony within humans, rooted in traditional Chinese medicine and its philosophy, to bring unique garments to life.
                <p><b>Root</b></p>
                After graduating from the London College of Fashion in 2017, Tai moved to Paris where he met his wife, Isa Kwai, who now acts as his muse along with the manager of his small atelier. For Tai, clothing is an extension of the human skin and is about people and their connection to nature, and how the ideal elemental balance brings forth the utmost well-being in us.
                <p></p>
                The label aims to "show the variation of this relationship with time and environments." He takes inspirations from his native Taiwan and heritage, along with the cities of London and Paris. However, more fundamentally, Tai seeks to apply the concept of elemental harmony derived from traditional Chinese philosophy. The ideal balance between earth, wood, metal, fire and water are continually explored in the label's offerings, from the production to the aesthetic of each and every garment.

                <p><b>Sprout</b></p>
                Starting in 2019, Peng Tai has started to present collections with an emphasis on each element, detailing their characteristics through the garments and their styling. Extended details of each collection can be found on their official site, however, here is a summary.
                <p></p>
                The Earth Project, is an exploration of how everything comes from, and eventually becomes, part of the Earth. The purity of various natural fabrics are showcased, with a sense of strange familiarity and an ephemeral quality that underpins the pieces.
                <p></p>
                The Metal Project explores the human transformation upon fabrics, having a focus on certain cutting and sewing techniques, exploring how we interact with the natural environment. This is seen through the technicality of the garments and the stitching, along with cues from Edwardian workwear, referencing the period of time in which humanity began to interact significantly with the environment.
                <p></p>
                The Fire Project focuses on dyeing methods, presenting a range of darker hues associated with the warmth and vitality that fire brings to human life. As such, this collection brings youthful cues in its silhouettes, along with unique garment dyeing techniques, such as using traditional Chinese medicinal herbs in the dyeing process, believed to bring balance to the vital organs.
                <p></p>
                The Water Project explores several washing techniques creating a varied presentation of hues and gradients with every piece. Along with that, the fabrics are shown in a way emphasises fluidity in movement, both in the way the garment rests on the body and how it allows the wearer to move.
                <p></p>
                The Wood Project explores the fabric's relation with time and how they progress as we wear them, accentuated by the concept of maturity. This is shown in the inclusion of muted palettes, reserved silhouettes, and a lingering sense of chic regality that distinguishes this particular collection.

                <p><b>Growth</b></p>
                Peng Tai has gained a notable following since its inception, however the stockists of this label remain strictly limited worldwide. The label is carried in stores in China, Vietnam, Paris, Tokyo and Australia among others. The Sydney-based boutique Pieces is the only stockist in Australia of Peng Tai. The label's growth represents a growing interest in Asian designers tapping into their heritage and exploring both traditional and modern expressions of ideas, pushing the envelope in the fashion world in areas where Western labels traditionally lacked.
