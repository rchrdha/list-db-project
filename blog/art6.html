                Widely worn by influencers and regular people alike, the Panda Dunks have been the most recognisable pair of “limited” sneakers of 2021 and 2022 thus far, from the perspective of a person looking at the fashion zeitgeist from the outside. The Panda dunk’s rise to notoriety is an excellent example of Nike’s marketing mechanisms, particularly how to manufacture popularity and cement it. 
                <p></p>
                Dunks had a period of popularity during the 00s, however, the era in discussion now is the late 2010s. After the impact of “The Ten” collection by Virgil Abloh and Nike, the brand sought a new path into the centre of youth culture. Coinciding with this period was the release of Travis Scott’s “Astroworld.” The subsequent release of this album cemented Travis as the spiritual ambassador of the youth, and so Nike had set their sights. Aside from his own collaborations, such as the Air Jordan 1 or the Air Force 1, Travis was also one of the key figures in re-invigorating the hype behind Nike Dunks. 
                <p><img class="standard-image" src="https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_crop,h_4941,w_3670,x_16,y_431/c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,q_90,w_1400/fl_lossy,pg_1/dqkt4tpslxjrdazrehxw/travis-scott-something-in-the-water" alt="Travis Scott wearing dunks"></p>
                Previously left at outlets, people were beginning to take the Dunks off the shelves as a gesture of admiration or aspiration. In response, Nike brought back all the original colour-ways from the 1985 campaign, “Be True to Your School.” An instant hit, every single pair flew from shelves and instantly gained traction on the resale market. As such, Nike brought back most colours (and some collaborations) from the past and re-released them to a newer generation, solidifying the Nike Dunks as the key shoe of late 2010s. However, at this point, there was still a high entry bar into obtaining a pair, as a result of the high demand and low supply. Combined with the idea that most of the options were a combination of white and specific colour, it wasn’t long until the Panda Dunks were slated to release.

                Black and white is generally considered to be extremely versatile, meaning it suits a wide array of outfits and aesthetics. And so, this colour combination in conjunction with the popularity of the dunk silhouette, the hype around this initial release was enormous.  Of course, they sold out and people still couldn’t get them, but Nike’s masterplan was yet to be complete. Progressing through 2020, 2021, and 2022, Nike released a release calendar, with the Panda Dunk making an appearance quite regularly. Restocks of the model being announced translated into hopeful individuals wanting to grab a pair, and if they do manage such a feat, everyone in their circles will be influenced to do the same. Nike repeated this process until both the primary and secondary markets have become flooded with Panda Dunks, and its derivative models, all offering consumers a “gateway” into this cultural phenomenon. 
                <p><img class="standard-image" src="https://houseofheat.co/app/uploads/2020/12/nike-dunk-low-white-black-release-date-dd1503-101-dd1391-100-1200x750.jpg" alt="Panda Dunks"></p>
                The ripple effect, manufactured by Nike through their periodical re-stocks, have caused the Panda Dunks to become a worldwide phenomenon, despite quality control deteriorating with each additional release. Other brands, seeing Nike perfect the funnel of storytelling to strong customer base followed suit, and it evidently can be seen in the recent rise of the New Balance 550s. In today’s zeitgeist, where public perception is everything, following in the footsteps of influencers sends a subliminal message to others that maybe we, regular people, can also aspire to be like these celebrities’, however small that aspect may be.
                <p></p>
                Or… maybe the Panda Dunks just look good with everything.
